# quick-reply.mmbundle
MailMate Bundle to implement quick message replies. Similar to the feature used in many mail clients today. I like the [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) implementation and used it as a guide for this bundle.

Make sure you have `python3` installed, [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/)
